##### About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Jose Andhika Putra, a first-year Information Systems student at IBI Kwik Kian Gie, Indonesia.
Iâ€™m passionate about Frontend Development, UI/UX design, and game development.
My dream is to create a popular game, either under my own name or through a future studio I build.

Currently, Iâ€™m focused on building my personal brand while diving deeper into the world of programming.
I aim to share my knowledge with the next generation to help them prepare for the future of technology.

ðŸŽµ I enjoy music from artists like Adele, Laufey, Wave to Earth, JKT48, Maroon 5, and more.
